ValueInvestor (Investment and Stock Markets):

This project is for a portfolio investment company that makes investments in the emerging markets around the world and makes profits by investing in profitable companies, buying, holding and selling company stocks based on value investing principles.

The goal of this project is to establish a robust intelligent system to aid the investing efforts using stock market data. The investment decisions are based on intrinsic value of companies and not on the basis of daily market volatility. The aim is to predict stock price valuations and recommend BUY, HOLD, SELL decisions to maximize capital returns and minimize losses. Bollinger Bands are used to measure the system's effectiveness.
